# astro-coffee
A website for a fictional coffee company. This is the first site I've ever built end-to-end. The front end is purely HTML, CSS, and Javascript, no frameworks or libraries. The backend server is Node.js and is connected to a MongoDB database, holding information gathered from the client. That data can be used in the company web app, which will also be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
